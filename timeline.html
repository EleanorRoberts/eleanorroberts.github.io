					<h3>Risk Management Operations Specialist</h3>

					</p>
					<p class="timeline-date">May 2019 - October 2020
					</p>
					<p>In my role as (Data Entry) RMO Specialist, I did many things with my time which were all very impressive and involved lots of PV which I absolutely love and was not the reason I then transferred out of the industry and into coding which is much more suied to my tastes. I love logic puzzles, and whilst the overly large excel spreadsheets at Celgene/BMS were satisfying to correctly create/adjust/filter they are not as fun as what is essentially a big beautiful new rubix cube for me to play with.

					<h3>Bartending</h3>
					<p class="timeline-company">The Lord Nelson
					</p>
					<p class="timeline-date">September 2016 - May 2019
					</p>
					<p>Working as a bartender at this local pub, I had a great time making friends with the regulars and seeing them get spectacularly drunk (and occassionally helping them get home afterwards). I worked on my beautiful social skills, ability to let drunken bulls**t roll off my back, and general stock management/time management/interpersonal and management skill improvement.
